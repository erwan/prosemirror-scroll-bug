# Scroll bug

To test, just open `index.html` in a browser.

 * Scroll up and down with the mouse wheel/touchpad: the green bar stays always visible
 * Add new lines in the prosemirror editor until it causes a scroll to keep the cursor visible: the green bar gets hidden, it should stay visible like when scrolling with the wheel

Tested on Chrome OSX Version 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit)
